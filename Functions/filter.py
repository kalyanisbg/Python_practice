'''
We were given a list of lists, where each sublist holds the title of a famous 
book that has a year as its title and the last name of the author that wrote 
the book. Unfortunately, when this list was made, each of the books was 
accidentally entered twiceâ€”once with the title as a numeric value and once 
with the title as a string. Use the filter() function to deduplicate the list 
and keep only the sublists that have the book title stored as a string:
books = [["Burgess", 1985],
 ["Orwell", "Nineteen Eighty-four"],
  ["Murakami", "1Q85"],
   ["Orwell", 1984],
    ["Burgess", "Nineteen Eighty-five"],
     ["Murakami", 1985]]
